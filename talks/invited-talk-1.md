# Invited Talk: How Complex AI Workflows Are Driving the Future of HPC Architectures? 

**Speaker:** [Debbie Bard](/speakers/debbie-bard)  
**Time:** 09:30 AM - 10:00 AM  
**Session Type:** Invited Talk

## Abstract

One of the biggest challenges in scientific supercomputing today is the increasing complexity of workflows, driven by the rapid increase in AI adoption in all aspects of scientific computing. These place new demands on traditional HPC infrastructure, which now need to support workflows combining data preparation and movement, AI model training and inference, analysis and large-scale simulations. In this talk, I will describe the complex AI HPC workflows that are driving the design of Doudna, NERSC’s next supercomputer, and the design of a broader architecture across DOE to support an Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI). Through case studies and real-life challenges, I will describe how AI-driven requirements translate to technical innovations for Doudna and IRI.

## Speaker Bio

Dr. Debbie Bard is a physicist and data scientist with 20 years experience in scientific computing, working in particle physics, cosmology and HPC. She leads the Science Engagement and Workflows department at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing center (NERSC), responsible for delivering HPC, data and AI services for NERSC’s 11,000 users, including user support and engagement. She is particularly interested in multi-facility science and integrating experimental facilities with HPC. Debbie has led multiple complex cross-institutional projects, for example the Superfacility initiative at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and the DOE’s Integrated Research infrastructure program.
