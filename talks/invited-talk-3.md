# Invited Talk: Intelligent Workflows at Scale: AI-Driven Exploration of Cosmological Simulations

**Speaker:** [Katrin Heitmann](/speakers/katrin-heitmann)  
**Time:** 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM  
**Session Type:** Invited Talk

## Abstract

Understanding the evolution of the Universe from its earliest moments to the present is one of the central goals of modern physics. Achieving this requires not only next-generation observational instruments but also the ability to simulate the Universe at extreme scale. These large-scale cosmological simulations, run on leadership-class supercomputers, generate massive datasets and require complex, multi-step workflows for analysis and interpretation.
In this talk, I will present a recent suite of simulations performed with the Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC), a highly scalable code designed for performance on heterogeneous architectures. To support analysis at scale, we developed OpenCosmo, a cross-platform workflow system that orchestrates simulation data processing across multiple supercomputing environments. Building on this foundation, we are now integrating an agentic AI system that simplifies and automates intricate workflows, supports adaptive exploration, and enables more intuitive human–machine interaction with the data. While still in early stages, this integration of HPC, workflow technologies, and AI illustrates the emerging paradigm of intelligent scientific computing and its potential to accelerate discovery in complex domains like cosmology.
