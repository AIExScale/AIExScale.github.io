# Invited Talk: AI-Ready Scientific Workflows at Scale: Bridging Data, Infrastructure, and Automation

**Speaker:** [Rafael Ferreira da Silva](/speakers/rafael-ferreira-da-silva)  
**Time:** 10:30 AM - 11:00 AM  
**Session Type:** Invited Talk

## Abstract

The convergence of AI and large-scale scientific workflows presents a transformative opportunity to accelerate discovery across domains. However, this integration is challenged by fragmented data lifecycles, heterogeneous infrastructure, and the need for scalable orchestration frameworks that are both AI- and HPC-aware. In this talk, I will present an end-to-end vision and practical strategies for enabling AI-ready scientific workflows at scale. This includes integrating domain-specific foundation models, automating data staging across distributed resources, and leveraging adaptive workflow systems to optimize performance, cost, and energy usage. Drawing from real-world use cases within DOE science domains, I will outline a community roadmap for building interoperable, scalable, and FAIR-aligned ecosystems that support both traditional simulations and next-generation AI models in federated environments.
