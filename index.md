# Description

Extreme-scale workflows play a crucial role in increasing scientific productivity by helping scientists orchestrate today’s scientific campaigns. With the recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and its growing application in scientific campaigns, we started to witness the integration of AI tasks into scientific workflows (workflows for AI). There can also be significant benefits for existing scientific workflows when augmenting them with AI (AI for workflows). Given the early stage of these emerging topics, more effort is needed to outline the role of AI in scientific workflows. The 1st International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Extreme-Scale Workflows will provide the scientific community with a dedicated platform for discussing current efforts, opportunities, and open challenges in AI and scientific workflows. This symposium features invited talks given by the leaders in the field and aims to further advance AI workflows by fostering new connections and ideas among the workshop participants.

This symposium will actively drive discussion and aim to
answer the following questions:

# Goals

This symposium will run for a half day, consisting of two sessions. In the first session, there will be opening remarks followed by a keynote from an expert in the field of workflows. Then, there will be a break of 30 minutes. In the second session, there will be three invited talks of 30 minutes each followed by a moderated discussion between the audience with the speakers.

The coffee and lunch breaks will follow the SC conference schedule. These breaks will provide an opportunity for the attendees, speakers, and organizers to interact and have fruitful discussions revolving around the role of AI in extreme-scale workflows.
